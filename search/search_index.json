Optional fields: title: string the title of the view default: 'Thank you for taking part in this experiment!' prolificConfirmText: string text asking the participant to press the 'confirm' button default: 'Please press the button below to confirm that you completed the experiment with Prolific' Trial views Trial views are the parts of your experiment which are (usually) instantiated several times (realizing different trials of your, say, main experimental task). They usually collect the data and often rely on additional information (e.g., the picture to be displayed in trial 27, or the question and answer options for trial 13). All trial views have three obligatory fields : trials: int the number of trials this view will appear name: string the name of the view data: array list of objects, each with information for each consecutive trial Different types of wrapping views have more optional fields, as documented below. Forced-choice task Instantiate with babeViews.view_generator('forced_choice', ...) Displays a context, a picture and a question to be answered in a two-alternative forced choice task. Choices are made by clicking on one of two buttons. Obligatory Fields option1: string - text on button for option 1 option2: string - text on button for option 2 Optional Fields question: string - question to be asked QUD: string - text that is always present on the slide canvas: object - more about babe canvas picture: string (link) - picture to be displayed Sample data const forced_choice_trials = [ { picture: \"path/to/picture_of_questionmark.jpg\", question: \"What's the weather like? like?\", option1: \"shiny\", option2: \"rainbow\" } ]; Sentence Choice task Instantiate with babeViews.view_generator('sentence_choice', ...) . Similar to the forcedChoice view, this view presents two text-based options to click on. This view, however, realizes options on longer buttons arranged vertically. This is better for choice between several longer expressions, like whole sentences. Obligatory Fields option1: string option2: string Optional Fields QUD: string - text that is always present on the slide canvas: object - more about babe canvas picture: string (link) question: string Sample data const sentence_choice_trials = [ { picture: 'path/to/picture_of_bread.jpg', question: \"What's on the bread?\", option1: 'jam', option2: 'ham' }, { picture: 'path/to/picture_of_bread.jpg', option1: 'jam', option2: 'ham' }, { question: \"What's the weather like?\", option1: 'shiny', option2: 'rainbow' } ]; Image Selection task Instantiate with babeViews.view_generator('image_seletion', ...) .

You could realize this when instantiating your view like this: const forced_choice_2A = babeViews.view_generator(\"key_press\", { trials: trial_info.forced_choice.length, name: 'forced_choice_2A', data: trial_info.forced_choice, pause: 1000, fix_duration: 250 }); Hooks For minor customization of the template views, you can create functions, ideally in file 02_custom_functions.js and hook these functions to specific steps in the life cycle of a trial view. The following hooks exist where your custom functions could attach: after the pause is finished enable with hook.after_pause: _function_ after the fixation point hides enable with hook.after_fix_point: _function_ after the stimulus is shown enable with hook.after_stim_shown: _function_ after the stimulus hides enable with hook.after_stim_hidden: _function_ after the interactions are enabled enable with hook.after_response_enabled: _function_ Your custom functions get the trial data for each trial view and next as arguments. You can use the data if you need to. To proceed to the next step of the lifecycle, you have to call next() Full lifecycle - hook sample pause shows pause finishes after_pause function called fixation point shows fixation point disappears after_fix_point function called stimulus shows after_stim_shown function called stimlus hides after_stim_hidden function called response is enabled after_response_enabled function called Example: response check Imagine you want to tell the participants whether their choice was right or wrong, e.g., during practice trials. We could realize this with a function which checks the answer for correctness which is hooked to the \"response-enabled step\". Of course, your data for each trial needs to include the information which answer is correct. For the Departure-Point example, we could add this information to 04_trials.js like so: forced_choice: [ { question: \"What's on the bread?\", picture: \"images/question_mark_02.png\", option1: 'jam', option2: 'ham', correct: 'jam' // which option is correct? }, { question: \"What's the weather like?\", picture: \"images/weather.jpg\", option1: \"shiny\", option2: \"rainbow\", correct: \"shiny\" // which option is correct? } ] We then define the function to be hooked, ideally in file 02_custom_functions.js : // compares the chosen answer to the value of `option1` check_response = function(data, next) { $('input[name=answer]').on('change', function(e) { if (e.target.value === data.correct) { alert('Your answer is correct!

Installation on Heroku The _babe server app can be hosted on any hosting service or your own server. We here describe the process for installation on Heroku . Heroku makes it easy to deploy an web app without having to manually manage the infrastructure. It has a free starter tier, which should be sufficient for the purpose of running experiments. There is an official guide on how to deploy the Phoenix framework on Heroku. The deployment procedure is based on this guide, but differs in some places. {:start=\"0\"} 0. Ensure that you have the Phoenix Framework installed and working. However, if you just want to deploy this server and do no development work/change on it at all, you may skip this step. Ensure that you have a Heroku account already, and have the Heroku CLI installed and working on your computer. Ensure you have Git installed. Clone this git repo with git clone https://github.com/babe-project/BABE or git clone git@github.com:babe-project/BABE.git . cd into the project directory just cloned from your Terminal (or cmd.exe on Windows). Run heroku create --buildpack \"https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir.git\" Run heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static.git (N.B.: Although the command line output tells you to run git push heroku master , don't do it yet.) You may want to change the application name instead of using the default name. In that case, run heroku apps:rename newname . Edit line 17 of the file config/prod.exs . Replace the part babe-backend.herokuapp.com after host with the app name (shown when you first ran heroku create , e.g. mysterious-meadow-6277.herokuapp.com , or the app name that you set at step 6, e.g. newname.herokuapp.com ). You shouldn't need to modify anything else. Ensure that you're at the top-level project directory. Run heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev heroku config:set POOL_SIZE=18 Run mix deps.get then mix phx.gen.secret . Then run heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE=\"OUTPUT\" , where OUTPUT should be the output of the mix phx.gen.secret step. Note: If you don't have the Phoenix framework installed on your computer, you may choose to use some other random generator for this task, which essentially asks for a random 64-character secret. On Mac and Linux, you may run openssl rand -base64 64 . Or you may use an online password generator such as the one offered by LastPass . Run git add config/prod.exs , then git commit -m \"Set app URL\" . Don't forget to set the environment variables AUTH_USERNAME and AUTH_PASSWORD , either in the Heroku web interface or via the command line, i.e. heroku config:set AUTH_USERNAME=\"your_username\" heroku config:set AUTH_PASSWORD=\"your_password\" Run git push heroku master . This will push the repo to the git remote at Heroku (instead of the original remote at Github), and deploy the app. Run heroku run \"POOL_SIZE=2 mix ecto.migrate\" Now, heroku open should open the frontpage of the app. Installation locally The first-time installation requires an internet connection. After it is finished, the server can be launched offline. (Note that for local deployment, the default username is default and the default password is password . You can change them in config/dev.exs .) First time installation To begin with, install Docker from https://docs.docker.com/install/ . You may have to launch the application once in order to let it install its command line tools. Verify the installation by typing docker version in a terminal (e.g., the Terminal app on MacOS or cmd.exe on Windows). Note: - Although the Docker app on Windows and Mac asks for login credentials to Docker Hub, they are not needed for local deployment. You can proceed without creating any Docker account/logging in. - Linux users would need to install docker-compose separately. See relevant instructions here . Once you have Docker installed, follow these steps: Ensure you have Git installed. Clone the server repo with git clone https://github.com/babe-project/BABE.git or git clone git@github.com:babe-project/BABE.git . Open a terminal (e.g., the Terminal app on MacOS or cmd.exe on Windows), cd into the project directory just cloned via git.

As long as this folder is preserved, experiment results should persist as well.","title":"Deployment"},{"location":"02_using_the_server_app/02_use/","text":"Use After installation you can visit the server app in a browser, with the username and password you previously specified. For Heroku deployment, you may do so by running heroku open in the command line or find the app URL in your Heroku account. For local deployment, the URL is by default http://localhost:4000. The server app shows a list of experiments whose data may be stored in a database. It shows the experiments ID, its name, its author, the number of submissions retrieved so far, date information, as well as whether the experiment is currently active or not. If an experiment is set to be active, it allows further submissions to be recorded in the database. The server app allows you to retrieve the data for an experiment from the database. Simply click on the button \"Retrieve CSV\" to download a CSV-file with the data collected so far. To delete an experiment, click the \"Delete\" button. Always make sure that you have recovered all necessary data from that experiment; otherwise your data collected so far might be irrevocably lost. You can also edit an experiment with the \"Edit\" button. You can change information about the experiment on the edit-screen. You can also toggle whether the experiment is active or not. You can set a maximum number of submissions after which the experiment automatically toggles its activity status off. Any submission made by a participant to a non-active experiment is just lost and will not be recorded. This is to protect your database from pollution or attacks, but if used unwisely could also cause you loss of relevant data. Finally, the server app allows you to create and manage new experiments. Click on the \"New\" button to do this. The interface for creating a new experiment is parallel to editing an existing experiment. Importantly, you need to give some required information about a new experiment (name and author). If you want to use dynamic retrieval of experiment data (documented here ), you must specify which fields should be available to be retrieved by your API calls. This allows you to expose only the relevant fields, since the dynamic retrieval API is not password protected by default.","title":"Use"},{"location":"02_using_the_server_app/02_use/#use","text":"After installation you can visit the server app in a browser, with the username and password you previously specified.
