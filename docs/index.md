# _magpie
_magpie is a framework for building psychological online experiments that run in your browser.

It is composed of a server-side part that stores your experiment results and handles interactivity, and a client-side
part that runs in the participant's browser. You can use the same server instance for running multiple experiments.

This site serves the manual, which will guide you through the various features.
There is also [the _magpie reference](https://magpie-reference.netlify.app/) comprehensive list of _magpie's components
