# Mouse tracking
_magpie can track mouse movements during trials.

You can start collecting mouse tracking data by calling
[`$magpie.mousetracking.start()`](https://magpie-reference.netlify.app/#Mousetracking+start).

After the trial you can retrieve the tracking data using [`$magpie.mousetracking.getMouseTrack`](https://magpie-reference.netlify.app/#Mousetracking+getMouseTrack).

For convenience you can also use [`<MousetrackingStart>`](https://magpie-reference.netlify.app/#mousetrackingstart) in your
custom screens to start a new mouse track.
