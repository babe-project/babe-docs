# Trial Views

Trial views are the parts of your experiment which are (usually) instantiated several times (realizing different trials of your, say, main experimental task). They usually collect the data and often rely on additional information (e.g., the picture to be displayed in trial 27, or the question and answer options for trial 13).


## Forced-choice task

Instantiate with `babeView.forcedChoice`. Displays a context, a picture and a question to be answered in a two-alternative forced choice task. Choices are made by clicking on one of two buttons.

<img src='../../images/views_samples/view_fc.png' alt='sample' height='auto' width='auto' style="border:2px solid black" />

* **Obligatory Fields**
    * `option1: string` - text on button for option 1
    * `option2: string` - text on button for option 2

* **Optional Fields**
    * `question: string` - question to be asked
    * `QUD: string` - text that is always present on the slide
    * `canvas: object` - [more about babe canvas](05_canvas.md)
    * `picture: string (link)` - picture to be displayed

* **Sample data**

```
const forced_choice_trials = [
    {
        picture: "path/to/picture_of_questionmark.jpg",
        question: "What's the weather like? like?",
        option1: "shiny",
        option2: "rainbow"
    }
];
```
## Sentence Choice task

Instantiate with `babeViews.sentenceChoice`. Similar to the `forcedChoice` view, this view presents two text-based options to click on. This view, however, realizes options on longer buttons arranged vertically. This is better for choice between several longer expressions, like whole sentences.

<img src='../../images/views_samples/view_ss.png' alt='sample' height='auto' width='auto' style="border:2px solid black" />

* **Obligatory Fields**
    * `option1: string`
    * `option2: string`

* **Optional Fields**
    * `QUD: string` - text that is always present on the slide
    * `canvas: object` - [more about babe canvas](05_canvas.md)

    * `question: string`

* **Sample data**

```
const sentence_choice_trials = [
    {
        picture: 'path/to/picture_of_bread.jpg',
        question: "What's on the bread?",
        option1: 'jam',
        option2: 'ham'
    },
    {
        picture: 'path/to/picture_of_bread.jpg',
        option1: 'jam',

        option2: 'rainbow'
    }
];
```

## Image Selection task

Instantiate with `babeViews.imageSelection`. Realizes another 2-alternative forced choice task, by presenting two pictures (arranged horizontally) and requiring a click on one of the pictures.

        question: "What's on the bread?",
        option1: 'jam',
        option2: 'ham'
    }
];
```

## Textbox Input task
