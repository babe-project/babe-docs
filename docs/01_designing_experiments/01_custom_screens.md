# Custom screens
When the built-in screens are not enough for your purposes, you can define your own custom screens.

For this purpose there is an abstract [`<Screen>`](https://magpie-reference.netlify.app/#screen) component available with _magpie.

## Slides

As mentioned in the "Basics" section,
a screen consists of one or more slides, which are displayed one after the other. The code for a basic screen would then
look like this:

```html
<Screen>
    <template #0>
    Hello World
    </template>
</Screen>
```

This screen has exactly one slide, which displays "Hello world". Notice that we use numbered slots to define our slides.
If you would like to have another slide, you would need to use slot 1:

```html
<Screen>
    <template #0>
        Hello World
    </template>

    <template #1>
        Anybody here?
    </template>
</Screen>
```

The problem now is that there is no indication when to switch to the second slide. So, we will stay on slide 0 forever.

## Switching slides

However, _magpie lends us a hand here, and provides a function to go to the next slide:

```html
<Screen>
    <template #0="{ nextSlide }">
    Hello World
    </template>

    <template #1>
        Anybody here?
    </template>
</Screen>
```

Here, we obtain the `nextSlide` function from the Screen component, so we can use it in our first slide. We can now use it in an event handler for example.

```html
<Screen>
    <template #0="{ nextSlide }">
        Hello World
        <button @click="nextSlide">Next slide</button>
    </template>

    <template #1>
        Anybody here?
    </template>
</Screen>
```

Now our participants can click on the button to go to the next slide. We can also use a helper component to trigger
this automatically after some time:

```html
<Screen>
    <template #0="{ nextSlide }">
        Hello World
        <Wait :time="1000" @done="nextSlide" />
    </template>

    <template #1>
        Anybody here?
    </template>
</Screen>
```

This invisible component will wait one second and then call nextSlide for us, so effectively the first slide is only shown for one second.

Now, we're stuck on the second slide, however. How do we jump to the next screen?

## Switching screens
It turns out, there is a function for this as well:

```html
<Screen>
    <template #0="{ nextSlide }">
        Hello World
        <Wait :time="1000" @done="nextSlide" />
    </template>

    <template #1="{ nextScreen }">
        Anybody here?
        <button @click="nextScreen">Yes</button>
    </template>
</Screen>
```

After 1 second of displaying "Hello world", we display "Anybody here?" and when the participant clicks the "Yes" button,
we go to the next screen. Notice, that you have to inject the slot parameters you need (like `nextScreen`) in every slide
separately.

## Collecting data
Experiments are of course about collecting data, so we need some inputs to collect responses from our participants.

_magpie has some built-in input components ready for you. For example, you could use the RatingInput component to realize
a rating task:

```html
<Screen>
    <template #0>
        <RatingInput
            :right="very cute"
            :left="very appalling"/>
    </template>
</Screen>
```

This will display a 7-step rating going from "very appalling" to "very cute". To store the response somewhere, we can
inject the `measurements` object from the Screen component:

```html
<Screen>
    <template #0="{ measurements }">
        <RatingInput
            :right="very cute"
            :left="very appalling"
            :response.sync="measurements.rating" />
    </template>
</Screen>
```

Once, injected, we can a property of the measurements object to the `response` prop of the RatingInput. The magic here
is in the `.sync` suffix. This will make sure, that the assignment is two-way: If the participant changes their response,
`measurements.rating` will be changed automatically to always reflect the latest value.

To save all our measurements made in the current screen, we then use `save`:

```html
<Screen>
    <template #0="{ measurements, save, nextScreen }">
        <RatingInput
            :right="very cute"
            :left="very appalling"
            :response.sync="measurements.rating" />
        <button @click="save(); nextScreen()">Submit</button>
    </template>
</Screen>
```

However, as writing and injecting both functions all the time is cumbersome, there's a combined version of the two:

```html
<Screen>
    <template #0="{ measurements, saveAndNextScreen }">
        <RatingInput
            :right="very cute"
            :left="very appalling"
            :response.sync="measurements.rating" />
        <button @click="saveAndNextScreen">Submit</button>
    </template>
</Screen>
```

Once, the participant clicks "Submit", their rating will be stored in the data set for the current screen.

This architecture makes it possible to collect multiple responses per screen and even per slide:

```html
<Screen>
    <template #0="{ measurements, saveAndNextScreen }">
        <RatingInput
            :right="very cute"
            :left="very appalling"
            :response.sync="measurements.cuteness" />
        <RatingInput
            :right="very large"
            :left="very small"
            :response.sync="measurements.size" />
        <RatingInput
            :right="very interesting"
            :left="very boring"
            :response.sync="measurements.interest" />
    
        <button @click="saveAndNextScreen">Submit</button>
    </template>
</Screen>
```

## Validating measurements
Imagine we want to record a participant-entered text in a screen. For this we can use the textarea input.

```html
<Screen>
    <template #0="{ measurements, saveAndNextScreen }">
        <TextareaInput :response.sync="measurements.text" />
    
        <button @click="saveAndNextScreen">Submit</button>
    </template>
</Screen>
```

However, we often have some specifications about how such input should look like. This is where validations come in.
We can specify validations for measurements via the `validations` prop of the `Screen` component:

```html
<Screen :validations="{
      text: {
        minLength: $magpie.v.minLength(4),
        alpha: $magpie.v.alpha
      }
    }">
    <template #0="{ measurements, saveAndNextScreen }">
        <TextareaInput :response.sync="measurements.text" />
    
        <button v-if="!validations.text.$error" @click="saveAndNextScreen">Submit</button>
    </template>
</Screen>
```

Here, we specify two validations for our `text` measurement: The text must be at least 4 characters long and may
only contain alphabetical characters.

Below, on the submit button, we added an if-statement that makes sure, we only show the button, if there are no problems
with the measurement.

You may have noticed, we use [`$magpie.v`](https://magpie-reference.netlify.app/#Magpie+validators) to access the validators we needed this time. `$magpie.v` provides
a selection of generally useful validators. If you ever need a validator that is not in there, you can simply write a
function that returns true if the validation passed and false if it didn't.

```html
<Screen :validations="{
      text: {
        minLength: (text) => text.length >= 4,
        alpha: $magpie.v.alpha
      }
    }">
    <template #0="{ measurements, saveAndNextScreen }">
        <TextareaInput :response.sync="measurements.text" />
    
        <button v-if="!validations.text.$error" @click="saveAndNextScreen">Submit</button>
    </template>
</Screen>
```

Here, we've replaced the `minLength` validator with a hand-built validator that does the same thing.

## Separating custom screens into files
If we want to use a custom screen multiple times in our experiment, we can separate it out into a different `.vue` file as follows:


```html
<!-- LimitedTextareaScreen.vue -->
<template>
    <Screen :validations="{
          text: {
            minLength: (text) => text.length >= minLength,
            alpha: $magpie.v.alpha
          }
        }">
        <template #0="{ measurements, saveAndNextScreen }">
            <TextareaInput :response.sync="measurements.text" />
        
            <button v-if="!validations.text.$error" @click="saveAndNextScreen">Submit</button>
        </template>
    </Screen>
</template>

<script>
export default {
    name: 'LimitedTextareaScreen',
    props: {
        minLength: {
            type: Number,
            required: true
        }
    }
}    
</script>
```

Here, we simply define a new Vue component for the custom screen and introduce a prop called `minLength` to control validation.

To define a prop we always have to set two facts about it: What data type is it? (One of `Number`, `String`, `Array`, `Boolean`)
Is it required? If not, we have to set a default value using the `default` field.

```html
<script>
export default {
    name: 'LimitedTextareaScreen',
    props: {
        minLength: {
            type: Number,
            default: 10
        }
    }
}    
</script>
```

Now, we can use this screen component in our main experiment file.

```html
<!-- App.vue -->
<template>
  <Experiment title="_magpie demo">
    <!-- The contents of the #screens template slot
         define the screens of your experiment -->
    <template #screens>
      
      <!-- This is the welcome screen -->
      <InstructionScreen :title="'Welcome'">
        This is a sample introduction screen.
        <br />
        <br />
        This screen welcomes the participant and gives general information about
        the experiment.
        <br />
        <br />
        This mock up experiment is a showcase of the functionality of magpie.
      </InstructionScreen>

      <template v-for="i in 10">
        <LimitedTextareaScreen
            :key="i"
            :min-length="13" />
      </template>

      <PostTestScreen />

      <DebugResultsScreen />
    </template>
  </Experiment>
</template>

<script>
import LimitedTextareaScreen from './LimitedTextareaScreen'
export default {
  name: 'App',
  components: {LimitedTextareaScreen},
};
</script>
```

We import the new screen component into the current file using a normal import statement and afterwards register it as a
sub-component to be used as part of our main App component. Now, we can use it in the `<template>` part of the file.
