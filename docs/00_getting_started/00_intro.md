# Introduction

_magpie is a framework for building psychological online experiments that run in your browser.

It is composed of a server-side part that stores your experiment results and handles interactivity, and a client-side part that runs in the participant's browser. You can use the same server instance for running multiple experiments.

For now, we will take a look at the part that runs in the browser.
