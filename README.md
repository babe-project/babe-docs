The documentation is meant to be built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

To deploy the latest changes, first install mkdocs with `pip install mkdocs`, then run `mkdocs gh-deploy`, which will build the latest version of the documents, and publish the site with Github Pages.

You can run `mkdocs serve` to preview the documentation in your local browser before publishing it to Github Pages.
